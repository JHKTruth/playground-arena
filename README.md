Playground arena from past readings
* Spring web app w/ various templates [i.e. tiles, velocity, jsp]
* jQuery plugins with HTML5, CSS3, Canvas 3D [which belongs in HTML5 but is cool], requireJS, and etc
* Hibernate for DAO with MySQL for now
* MongoDB Java portion [possibly Cassandra later to play around]
* Sample Hadoop code
